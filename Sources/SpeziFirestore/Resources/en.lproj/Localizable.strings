"FIRESTORE_ERROR_CANCELLED" = "The operation was cancelled (typically by the caller).";
"FIRESTORE_ERROR_INVALIDARGUMENT" = "Client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from FailedPrecondition. InvalidArgument indicates arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g., an invalid field name).";
"FIRESTORE_ERROR_DEADLINEEXCEEDED" = "Deadline expired before operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the deadline to expire.";

"FIRESTORE_ERROR_RESOURCEEXHAUSTED" = "Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space.";
"FIRESTORE_ERROR_FAILEDPRECONDITION" = "Operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution.";
"FIRESTORE_ERROR_ABORTED" = "The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue like transaction aborts, etc.";

"FIRESTORE_ERROR_INTERNAL" = "Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by underlying system has been broken. If you see one of these errors, something is very broken.";
"FIRESTORE_ERROR_UNAVAILABLE" = "The service is currently unavailable. This is a most likely a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff.";
"FIRESTORE_ERROR_DATALOSS" = "Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.";
